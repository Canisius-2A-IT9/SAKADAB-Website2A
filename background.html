		<h1>The 3Cs & UP</h1>
		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
		With each letter signifying <span class = "motto">“Cooperation, Collaboration, Contribution, Unity, & Participation”</span>,
		3CUP is an organization in partnership with the SAKADAB institution. The 3CUP project exists to achieve a mission in which, with a sense of purpose to
		aim for a common goal, we seek to <span class = "motto">address the difficult matters</span> experienced within the advocacy and community of SAKADAB. The scheme of the 3CUP project contains three objectives
		to accomplish and execute — wherein the implementation of each will enable assistance in resolving the identified issues and problems of SAKADAB through amassing finance
		from different sources of income. Fulfilling the mission of 3CUP ensues the solution to the challenges in scarcity of resources that disrupt the operation and system of SAKADAB,
		most especially the unmet needs and lacking demands of the SAKADAB community. <br>
		The 3CUP project does not only solely exist for the struggles of SAKADAB and the hardships of its members. Besides that, our mission targets to cultivate the awareness of
		people and share relevant knowledge to others by educating them about the community of SAKADAB and the essential work of the institution. The 3CUP organization, with competence,
		compassion, and combined efforts, will accomplish spreading important information about the various internal and external aspects of the advocacy which allows individuals to develop a rigorous understanding of SAKADAB.

		<h1>Significance of Project</h1>
		<center><div class="sakadab6">

		<p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">
		The 3CUP project will address the problem of scarce resources in the financial category and healthcare needs of the SAKADAB community. This project will aid in <span class = "motto">growing an income</span> for the institution by the launching of a <u><span class = "motto">livelihood program</span></u> wherein consumer products produced by the SAKADAB community members will be sold in the selling service of 3CUP. Through this selling service, the 3CUP project will as well serve as a benefit for the individuals of SAKADAB because this project partners with the advocacy mission in which the physical abilities, talents, and skills within the capability of these individuals will be applied in the activity of creating consumer products. Therefore increasing the potential of the SAKADAB community to “improve the quality of living”, “enhance the lifestyle”, and “become self-reliant” just as what the mission of the institution aims which is to open various opportunities in order for the community members to make use of their different capacities. At the same time, we earn an income from this selling service.
		<br>
		Additionally, the 3CUP project will help in spreading awareness, cultivating people’s knowledge, influencing proactivity, and gaining volunteers, participants, fundraisers, offerers, and donors for the SAKADAB institution by initiating social movements or motions such as poster-making, fundraising, offerings, and donations. With these collective procedures, an income will be raised. 
		<br> <br>
		The 3CUP project will further extend support in resolving the issues of SAKADAB through including a <u><span class = "motto">gardening program</span></u>
		All in all, the overall amount of money developed through the implementations of the 3CUP project will be accumulated and transported to SAKADAB. As a result of the assembled sources of total income and its delivery to the institution, the SAKADAB advocacy will gain secured finance. SAKADAB will head towards <span class = "motto">ensuring economic stability</span> and then proceed with the essential goal to provide important resources that the community needs and demands.

		<h1>Problem Identification</h1>
		<p align = "center"><font size = "3"><span class = "motto">Our partner institution is SAKADAB.</span></font></p>
		<center><div class="sakadab5">
			<img src="sakadab5.jpg">
		</div></center>
		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
		The significant topics about the profile of our partner institution, SAKADAB, are mainly the financial resources aspects. SAKADAB is experiencing issues related to matters in <span class = "motto">scarce resources</span> of both categories in finance and healthcare needs.
		The severe drop in the income of SAKADAB is the current problem <span class = "motto">caused by the COVID-19 pandemic</span>, which results in the incapability of the institution to acquire and provide the demands and needs of the community; such as essential healthcare supplies,
		medical tools, and proper equipment. Healthcare is crucial and is the most important need especially for these 35 members who are disabled, abused, and neglected, yet SAKADAB is faced with troubles in addressing this due to their state of economic outcome which is negatively
		influenced by the difficulties rooted through the global pandemic. Aside from that, not only is SAKADAB unable to adequately obtain vital resources that are needed for the wellbeing and health of their people, but the advocacy will as well likely go through struggles in
		meeting payment demands on utility bills wherein all consumption of water and electricity (plus other outgoings or expenses) are in critical condition because of an insufficient amount of money in the SAKADAB institution.
