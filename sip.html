    <h1>SCIENCE INVESTIGATORY PROJECT <br> "Banana Peels and Camote Tops Leaves"</h1>
</div>

<div class="contentsip">

    <h3>I. Background and Significance of the Study</h3>
        <p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">
            Our study of banana peel compost and its effects on the number of leaves of Camote Tops is vital for the community and the environment.
            The value of composting is <span class = "motto">essential in various numbers of ways,</span> one of which is that this method, if practiced and implemented, will help reduce the amount of wasted food that we regularly discard in our daily lives. The act of composting is <span class = "motto">safe and healthy</span> for the environment because it <span class = "motto">nurtures plant growth</span> and can also <span class = "motto">prevent environmental issues.</span> Through our study, we will be able to grasp an understanding of the importance of composting, the effects of this, and the significant impact it will cause within communities and the environment. This research will educate and encourage community members and other individuals to apply these as sustainable procedures in their lifestyle routine, livelihood, surroundings, and even at home.
            <br> <br>
            The specific community and institution that our PT group is engaged with <span class = "motto">— SAKADAB —</span> can benefit from composting in general through utilizing compost as a fertilizer in order to <span class = "motto">promote healthy growth in the plants and crops</span> that surrounds the location of SAKADAB, and to lessen any leftover of food waste. If the environment is inhabited by flora of good condition, the oxygen being generated in the area is also <span class = "motto">clean and freshening</span> for the lungs when inhaled, thus <span class = "motto">preventing sickness</span> that an individual can catch. In addition, our SIP composting project can benefit the individuals of SAKADAB through presenting a method of composting Camote Tops, resulting in easy access to resources such as nutrition and sustenance for the community because it is naturally produced with the help of composting, and provided to the members of the SAKADAB community.

    <h3>II. Statement of the Problem</h3>
        <p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">How will <span class = "motto">banana peels as compost</span> affect the <span class = "motto">number of leaves</span> that Camote Tops will have in a 1-month period?</p>

    <h3>III. Hypothesis</h3>
        <p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">If we use banana peel as compost, then the number of Camote Tops leaves will <span class = "motto">increase.</span></p>

    <h3>IV. Review Of Related Literature</h3>
        <p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">
            Compost in general is a mixture of organic plant matter that decomposes, which is used to <span class = "motto">improve the health and growth</span> of plants and crops. This practice involves the use of food waste or scraps, leaves, and other organic matter being processed by the bacteria and organisms that decompose these. As a result, it becomes decomposed organic matter that contains nutrients and minerals that a plant can absorb. Because of these existing chemicals and biomolecules, compost can not only be used as a fertilizer to supply benefits for a plant’s growth and production, but also provide <span class = "motto">advantages for environment</span> as well. One of the many number of positive effects that composts bring are <span class = "motto">reduction of the amount of waste</span> being thrown in our environment; this is because, as stated earlier, compost is generally made out of food waste that we usually discard away — which can be utilized as an improvement for the condition of soil because of the compost’s nutrients that also serve as a more environmentally friendly fertilizer in opposition to chemical fertilizers.
            <br> <br> <span class = "motto">The plant that our SIP will be focusing on is Camote Tops.</span>

        <p align = "justify"> <font size = "3">
            It is a plant rich in potassium, vitamin c also known as ascorbic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iron, and riboflavin which all are beneficial for a person's health. For Camote tops, a decent balance of fertilizer or compost that contain essential nutrients for the condition of the plant such as <span class = "motto">phosphorus, potassium,</span> and other chemicals will result in adequate health condition and thriving growth. Without the importance of these, the survival of the plant will be limited, restricted, and will not be able to reach its optimal level of growth that will supply us with a high amount of harvest. To add, Camote Tops need chemicals from different classes of <span class = "motto">biomolecules</span> to encourage tillering, development of all plant parts, boost root growth, and imrpove water usage effectiveness. <span class = "motto">Pectins</span> are vital forms of carbohydrates for Camote Tops as it functions for hydration and plant cell tissues. Furthermore, <span class = "motto">cellulose</span> is an organic compound and is well-known as a major component in the plant cell wall by maintaining the strength and stability of the structure by defining cells and building tissues. <span class = "motto">Dietary fiber,</span> on the other hand, is another type of carbohydrate found in the cell walls of a plant that is produced through photosynthesis in order to support the metabolism of the plant.
            <br> <br>
            To deliver the needed nutrients to Camote Tops, an effective compost for the health, condition, and growth can be <span class = "motto">banana peels.</span> These fruit scraps are <span class = "motto">rich in potassium and phosphorus</span> — both of which are the nutrients that Camote Tops essentially need for improved survival and development.
            <br> <br>
            For the composting process, instead of simply laying a banana peel on the soil, another alternative method is to <span class = "motto">mince 15 banana strips</span> and then proceed to mix these contents altogether with <span class = "motto">loam soil.</span> With this kind of strategy of applying compost to Camote Tops, it can be certain that the biomolecules contained in the minced banana peel will be <span class = "motto">determinedly distributed</span> to the soil of the test plant. Some other benefits that the compost can provide to the plant other than chemicals is that there will be <span class = "motto">better soil structure</span> because with the addition of compost, the soil will allow more air to be circulated and overall, will promote healthier soil structure.
            <br> <br>
            Direct or trench composting are the best methods for effectively applying compost to plants so that these plants can benefit from the <span class = "motto">nutrients, chemicals, biomolecules,</span> and other advantages it carries. It is a composting technique that creates nutrient-rich soil that keeps moisture and lessens the need for chemical fertilizers. It promotes the growth of <span class = "motto">helpful bacteria and fungi</span> that decompose organic material to produce humus. It feeds and nourishes already-existing plants. This kind of composting process will help the plant <span class = "motto">produce naturally.</span>
