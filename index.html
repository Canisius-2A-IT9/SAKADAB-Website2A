		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
			<span class = "motto">SAKADAB (Samahan ng may iba’t ibang Kakayahan sa Dabaw)</span> is an institution that exists for a mission to <span class = "motto">improve the quality of living, enhance the lifestyle, offer all kinds of help and care, and uplift the dignity</span> of disabled, neglected, and abused people. The community of SAKADAB consists of <span class = "motto">PWD and differently-abled</span> individuals whose ages range from <span class = "motto">20-50yo,</span> each coming from the <span class = "motto">Davao Region.</span>  It is run by <span class = "motto">SAKADAB President Ludivico Mascariñas Jr.</span>
		</font></p>
		<div class="sakadab1">

		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
			As an advocacy, the SAKADAB organization functions as one and is committed to the mission of extending the utmost forms of <span class = "motto">support</span> (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, moral, financial) towards its community members with a dedicated purpose to <span class = "motto">encourage</span> their overall <span class = "motto">wellbeing and health.</span> 
			With a common goal to develop oneself into becoming <span class = "motto">self-reliant,</span> the members who reside inside the SAKADAB community are given <span class = "motto">wide opportunities</span> to apply and utilize their physical abilities, capacities, talents, and skills that are within their capability which can be of great use in their <span class = "motto">daily livelihood.</span> These physically-challenged individuals are not employed in a fixed occupation, but their productive efforts vary in their everyday living. By specific means, these day-to-day <span class = "motto">physical activities</span> include but are not limited to namely baking, handicraft, woodcraft, farming, welding, and further interests or hobbies that lead them into producing <span class = "motto">consumer products or creative works.</span> Because of these beneficial chances, the possibilities of these united people are broadened and they are enabled to explore themselves, expand many significant lifestyle experiences, and engage in hands-on entertainment despite their physical incapabilities and hardships.

		<h3>Community</h3>
		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
			Since the community is composed of people who have <span class = "motto">disabilities</span> and encountered <span class = "motto">abuse or neglect,</span> the topmost priority of the SAKADAB institution is mainly to consistently provide for the <span class = "motto">health</span> of these individuals. <span class = "motto">Essential healthcare resources</span> such as medical supplies, proper equipment, and other <span class = "motto">health needs</span> are highly important to be acquired or accessed at all times and provided regularly for the community members of SAKADAB. With the amount of money that the institution all in all possesses, this is used to purchase proper healthcare and to gain access to other urgent resources which are needed by the residing community of SAKADAB consisting of PWD and differently-abled people.

		<p align = "justify"><font size = "3">
			Hence, it is vital that the <span class = "motto">income of the advocacy</span> is stable because this is a crucial factor for SAKADAB to be able to obtain the <span class = "motto">required resources.</span> A financial security in the organization that is certain and assured is the major key for SAKADAB in order to continuously aim towards the objective of <span class = "motto">satisfying community needs</span> and <span class = "motto">meeting payment demands</span> (utility bills, expenses, outgoings). Otherwise if there is a severe drop in income or if finance is not greatly established, the advocacy will face a crisis along the way, thus issues and problems will arise in the operation of the organization. As a negative result, this will lead to <span class = "motto">scarcity</span> in the work of SAKADAB and the advocacy mission may not be fulfilled. SAKADAB must avoid this experience.
			<br> <br>
			The institution has been earning funds and receiving countless sorts of donations and offerings thanks to the strength of supportive people who serve as volunteers, donors, offerers, fundraisers, sponsors, and even students who have raised their voice, initiated movements or motions, proposed projects or programs to implement, and spread awareness for the mission of SAKADAB. The Davao government officials and more companions, along with the Davao Light company, the Ateneo de Davao University, and others have been incredibly helpful and thoughtful for the SAKADAB organization and advocacy.
